            If I could, I'd be your little spoon <br>
            And kiss your fingers forevermore <br>
            But, big spoon, you have so much to do <br>
            And I have nothing ahead of me.

            You're the sun, you've never seen the night <br>
            But you hear its song from the morning birds <br>
            Well I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star <br>
            But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

            Your mother wouldn't approve <br>
            Of how my mother raised me <br>
            But I do, I think I do <br>
            And you're an all-American boy <br>
            I guess I couldn't help trying <br>
            To be your best American girl <br>
